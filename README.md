# Air-Quality-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

The project involved building a machine learning model to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various features such as temperature, humidity, and various pollutant levels.

**Data Collection:** We collected a dataset containing historical air quality data, including AQI values and related features like pollutant levels, city, and date.

**Data Preprocessing:** We performed data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).

**Model Training:** We trained machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) using the training data to learn the relationship between the features and the target variable (AQI).

**Model Evaluation**: We evaluated the trained models using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess how well they predicted the AQI values on unseen data (testing set).

**Interface Development:** Developed a user interface using Tkinter, a Python GUI toolkit, to allow users to input city names and dates and receive predictions of AQI values. The interface also provided safety measures based on the predicted AQI levels and visualized the predicted AQI values for the next five days using a line chart.

**For Future Enhancement:**

**Integration with External Data**: Integrated external data sources, such as historical weather data obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API, to enrich the dataset and improve the model's predictive performance.

**Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to handle invalid input formats and ensure smooth functioning of the interface.

**Improvement Strategies:** Strategies to improve the model's accuracy, such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and using more advanced machine learning techniques
